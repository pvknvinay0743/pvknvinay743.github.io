<h1 >Relative and Absolute URL's</h1>
<p>Relative URL's are used to link to resources within the same website. They are relative to the current page's URL. For example, if you are on the page "http://example.com/about.html" and you want to link to "http://example.com/contact.html", you can use a relative URL like "contact.html".</p>
<p>Absolute URL's, on the other hand, include the full path to the resource, including the protocol (http:// or https://) and the domain name. For example, "http://example.com/contact.html" is an absolute URL. Absolute URL's are used when linking to resources on different websites or when you want to ensure that the link works regardless of the current page's URL.</p>  

    
<a href="https://www.instagram.com">Link to Instagram(Absolute URL)</a>

<a href="paragraphs.html">Link to the paragraph(Relative URL)</a>

<!-- This file demonstrates the use of relative and absolute URLs in HTML. -->
 <!-- The absolute URL links to an external website (Instagram), while the relative URL links to another page within the same website (paragraphs.html). -->
<!-- The styling is applied to make the content visually appealing, with a background color and different colors for headings and paragraphs. -->
 <!--IN conclusing absolute means it starts with the full path including protocol and domain name.(like https://www.example.com/path/to/resource.html)-->
<!--Relative means it is relative to the current page's URL (meaning in the same directory or subdirectory of the current page  or simply could say as in the current folder for example i have paragraph in my current folder that is why i dont need add https and all i just need to type the name and after that.html)and does not include the full path.(like contact.html)-->
