<!-- In this code, we have created a hyperlink using the <a> tag and wrapped an <img> tag inside it. The href attribute of the <a> tag specifies the URL to which the link will navigate when clicked. The target="_blank" attribute ensures that the link opens in a new tab. The src attribute of the <img> tag specifies the path to the image file, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image. -->
<!-- When the user clicks on the image, they will be directed to the specified URL in a new tab. -->
<!-- Note: Make sure to replace the src attribute value with the correct path to your image file. -->
<!-- Also, ensure that the image file is accessible and properly linked in your project directory. -->
<!-- This code will create a clickable image that serves as a link to the specified URL. -->
<!-- You can customize the image and the URL as needed for your specific use case. -->
<!-- Remember to test the link and image to ensure they work correctly in your web browser. -->
