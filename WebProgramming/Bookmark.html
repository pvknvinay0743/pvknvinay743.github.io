<!-- This is a simple HTML document that demonstrates the use of bookmarks (also known as anchors) to navigate to specific sections of the page. The document contains 20 chapters, each with a heading and a paragraph. The first two paragraphs at the top provide links to jump directly to chapter 10 and chapter 20 using their respective IDs. 
 -->
<!-- When a user clicks on the "Jump to chapter 10" link, the browser will scroll down to the section with the ID "chap10". Similarly, clicking on the "Jump to chapter 20" link will scroll down to the section with the ID "chap20". This allows for easy navigation within a long document. -->
<!-- The use of the <style> tag in the <head> section centers the text of all <h2> and <p> elements, making the content visually appealing and easier to read. Each chapter is clearly labeled with a heading, and the corresponding paragraph provides a brief description or content for that chapter. -->
<!-- Overall, this HTML document serves as a simple example of how to use bookmarks to enhance user navigation within a webpage. -->
