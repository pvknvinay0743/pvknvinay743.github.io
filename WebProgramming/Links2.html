<!-- This HTML document contains multiple links with different target attributes. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. -->
<!-- The first link opens in a new tab or window (target="_blank"), the second link opens in the same frame (target="_self"), the third link opens in the parent frame (target="_parent"), and the fourth link opens in the full body of the window (target="_top"). -->
<!-- Each link is separated by a horizontal rule (<hr>) for better visual separation. -->
<!-- When a user clicks on any of these links, it will navigate to the YouTube website according to the specified target behavior. -->
<!--The difference between _parent and _top is that _parent opens the link in the parent frame, while _top opens it in the full body of the window.-->
