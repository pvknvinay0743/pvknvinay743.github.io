<!-- This HTML code creates a simple table with three columns: Name, Age, and City. The table has a border and the cells have a background color of aquamarine with red text. -->
 <!-- The table contains three rows of data for three individuals: Alice, Bob, and Charlie, along with their respective ages and cities. -->
  <!-- The table is structured using the <table> element, with <tr> elements for each row, <th> elements for the header cells, and <td> elements for the data cells. -->
<!-- The table is styled using CSS to enhance its appearance, making it visually appealing and easy to read. -->
