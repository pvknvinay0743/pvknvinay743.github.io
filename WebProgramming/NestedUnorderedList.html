<h2>A Nested List</h2>
<p>Lists can be nested (list inside list):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>Black tea</li>
      <li>Green tea</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

<!-- This HTML code creates a nested unordered list. The main list contains three items: "Coffee", "Tea", and "Milk". The "Tea" item has a nested unordered list with two items: "Black tea" and "Green tea". The nested list uses disc bullets for its items. -->
<!--The ul tag is used to define an unordered list. The nested ul tag creates a sublist within the main list. The style attribute with list-style-type: disc; sets the bullet style for the nested list items. -->
<!--If I don't specify a bullet style for the nested list, it prints default one of nested which is circle for nested lists.(but for outer is disc only) -->
