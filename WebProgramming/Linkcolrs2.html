<!-- This is a simple HTML document that demonstrates the use of CSS to style links. The document includes a heading and two links, each with different styles for their various states (link, visited, hover, active). The styles are defined in the <style> section within the <head> of the document. -->
<!-- The first link points to Instagram, while the second link points to another HTML file named "attributeofTitle.html". The CSS styles specify the colors and background colors for the links in their different states, as well as text decoration. -->
<!-- When the user clicks on the Instagram link, it will open the Instagram website. When the user clicks on the second link, it will navigate to the "attributeofTitle.html" page. The styles will change based on the user's interaction with the links, providing visual feedback. -->
<!-- The document is structured with a heading and two links, making it easy to understand the different link states and how they are styled using CSS. -->
<!-- Overall, this HTML document serves as a simple example of how to use CSS to style links and demonstrate the different states of links in a web page. -->
